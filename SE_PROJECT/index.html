                <h2>Trauma Center</h2>
                <p>A trauma center is a specialized medical facility within a hospital that is equipped to provide comprehensive, multidisciplinary emergency care for patients suffering from severe injuries or illnesses, such as car accidents, gunshot wounds, severe burns, or life-threatening medical conditions. The primary goal of a trauma center is to stabilize and treat critically injured patients as quickly and effectively as possible to increase their chances of survival and minimize the risk of long-term complications.</p>
