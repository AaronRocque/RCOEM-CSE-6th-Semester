    "This code aims to analyze a simple control-flow graph for a given set of statements. The primary objective is to identify leader statements, divide the statements into basic blocks, and create a flow graph to visualize how control flows between the blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `find_leaders(statements)`: This function takes a list of statements as input and returns a list of leader statements. A leader is the first statement in a basic block, which could be the target of a GOTO statement or the statement immediately after a GOTO statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `build_basic_blocks(statements, leaders)`: This function takes the list of statements and the identified leaders as input and creates basic blocks. A basic block is a sequence of consecutive statements with a single entry point (the leader) and a single exit point. The function returns a dictionary with block IDs as keys and lists of statements in the block as values.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `build_flow_graph(statements, basic_blocks)`: This function takes the list of statements and the basic blocks as input and constructs the control-flow graph. It creates edges between the basic blocks based on the GOTO and IF statements. The function returns a dictionary with block IDs as keys and lists of successor block IDs as values.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `sample_input`: This is a list of sample statements, where each statement is represented as a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The code then calls the `find_leaders`, `build_basic_blocks`, and `build_flow_graph` functions with the sample input to find leader statements, create basic blocks, and construct the control-flow graph, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Finally, the code prints the leader statements, basic blocks, and the program flow graph, showing the flow of control between the basic blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code output displays the leader statements, basic blocks, and the flow graph for the given sample input, which helps visualize the control flow of the given set of statements."
